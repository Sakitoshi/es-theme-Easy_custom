<!--
To change wallpaper replace the background.png image located
at the _background folder.
The image will be stretched to fill all the screen.

You can also add extra background images (they need to be png)
for every system by naming the images as the system
(e.g. snes.png, genesis.png, megadrive.png, etc... )
depending what its theme parameter is set on es_systems.cfg

For collections it need to be named after the collections
(auto-allgames.png, auto-favorites.png, auto-lastplayed.png
and custom-collections.png respectively)

Below you can change the brightness of the background image,
size of the grid view and the color of the text and text boxes.
