To change wallpaper replace the background.png image located
at the _background folder.

You can also add extra background images (they need to be png)
for every system by naming the images as the system
(e.g. snes.png, genesis.png, megadrive.png, etc... )

(auto-allgames.png, auto-favorites.png, auto-lastplayed.png
and custom-collections.png respectively)
